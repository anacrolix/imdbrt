Project inspired by Curtis Gibby's Greasemonkey script that was at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/12897. It now appears to be maintained at https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/7158-imdb-add-rottentomatoes-info.

The root directory contains various images that probably aren't required anymore. The item directory contains the actual extension code.

To create the release ZIP:

  zip item item/*

To update the source script, download the script from https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/7158-imdb-add-rottentomatoes-info to item/grease-script.js. Diff the saved file with the base and restore any relevant changes.
